# lein-pallet-release

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/palletops/lein-pallet-release.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/palletops/lein-pallet-release)

A Leiningen plugin to release PalletOps projects.

Releases are made by creating a local release branch which is pushed
to github.  The branch will be built by travis, and pushed to master
and develop if it succeeds.  Jars are then built locally from master
and pushed to clojars.

## Usage

Add the plugin to your `:user` `:plugins` in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clj
:plugins [[lein-pallet-release "0.1.2"]]
```
Install the
[travis command line](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2013-01-14-new-client/).

### init

The `init` subcommand is used to initialise a project for releasing
with a test on travis.  It requires a single argument, a 40 digit hex
github key for the `pbors` github user, that will be used to authorise
travis to push to github master if the build succeeds.  The key should
only have permissions to read and write repositories.

```
lein pallet-release init 435afe787ab878c32432435afe787ab878c32432
```

This will write the `.travis.yml` file if it doesn't exist.  It will also
add the plugin and configuration to `profiles.clj`.

After running the command, inspect the created files and commit them.

### start

To start a release, run:

```
lein pallet-release start previous-release new-release
```

This will create a release branch, enable the project on travis, and
update release notes, readme, etc.

After running, check the modifications.  Anything modified will be
commited by the `finish` command.

### finish

To finish a release, run:

```
lein pallet-release finish
```

This will commit any modified files (eg. README.md, project.clj, etc)
with a commit message including the version number.

It then pushes the branch to github, from where travis will build it,
and push it back to the `master` and `develop` branches on github.

### publish

When the travis build has successfully completed, publish the jars with:

```
lein pallet-release publish
```

This will pull master from github and use your locally setup for
publishing signed jars.
